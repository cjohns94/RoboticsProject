This will implement obstacle avoidance with Baxter. 

RRT directory contains files needed to run rrt_7d.py, which computes a 7d path through obstacles defined as follows:
(q1_lower, q2_lower,..., qNlower, q1_upper, q2_upper,...,qN_upper)

The rest of the files were forked from SZanlongo https://github.com/motion-planning/rrt-algorithms and modified to create the 7d path planner.
